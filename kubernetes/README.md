# 🛠️ Kubernetes Role
This role sets up and configures Kubernetes components, initializing a basic Kubernetes cluster. The role serves as a starting point for automating Kubernetes deployments with Ansible.

# 📜 Overview
The Kubernetes Role provides a framework for deploying and configuring Kubernetes cluster nodes. This role can help:

Set up kubeadm, kubectl, and kubelet dependencies.
Configure networking options and cluster initialization.
# 🛠️ Requirements
Before running this role, ensure the following:

Ansible is installed on the control machine.
SSH access to the target machine(s) is established.
The target OS is compatible (Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, Debian, etc.).
Any dependencies needed (e.g., iptables) are available on the target server.
🔑 Role Variables
Variables can be customized based on your environment or cluster configuration. You can set these variables in vars/main.yml, defaults/main.yml, or pass them directly using --extra-vars.

Below are some example variables:

yaml
Copy code
kubernetes_version: "1.26.0"
network_plugin: "calico"
🛡️ Dependencies
The role does not rely on other Galaxy roles but assumes a properly configured system with required utilities.

If working with cloud providers such as AWS, ensure that boto3 and other packages are available.
